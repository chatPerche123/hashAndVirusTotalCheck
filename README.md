# Hash and Virus Total Checker (VT API 3.0)
This application in Java is making use basic functionalities of the Virus Total 3.0 API (<a href=https://developers.virustotal.com/v3.0/reference#overview>here</a>).

This application give the possibility to either get the hashes (md5, sha1 and sha256 ) of the files you dragged in (1) by clicking on a link (clipboard). 

If you decide to provide your VT API key (2), you will have the possibility to add the scan of the files to the previous hash functionality and see the result by clicking on the provided link.

Links that will be present  into the (5) and the VT result will redirect in a new window.
If the file is unknown by VT Database, it will be 'queued' and the result will change eventually at your next scan.

Feel free to report any bugs and suggestion to help me improve.
